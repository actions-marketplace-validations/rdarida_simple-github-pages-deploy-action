# Project Template

Kick off your project with this template.

## Project setup
Rename all the occurrance of **"project-template"** and **"Project Template"** in the project before run `npm install`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `postinstall`
Runs right after `npm install`, and sets up [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/)

### `format`
Runs Prettier and formats all the **\*.js**, **\*.jsx**, **\*.ts**, **\*.tsx**, and **\*.json** files.

## What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories.

    ├── .vscode/
    ├── node_modules/
    ├── .editorconfig
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierignore
    ├── .prettierrc

1. **`.vscode/`**: This directory contains the project specific settings.json.

2. **`node_modules/`**: This directory contains all of the modules of the code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

3. **`.editorconfig`**: EditorConfig helps maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various editors and IDEs.

4. **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files should not track / not maintain a version history for.

5. **`.prettierignore`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). It tells the prettier which files should not format.

6. **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

7. **`LICENSE`**: This template is licensed under the MIT license.

8. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

9. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

10. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
